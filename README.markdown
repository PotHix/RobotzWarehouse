RobotzWarehouse
===============

RobotzWarehouse was created for the "Itau cultural gamejam".

Idea
----

The player needs to organize the boxes by color. When a line is fulfilled with
boxes with the same color the level is done.

For each level done the crane goes faster and the level becomes bigger.
