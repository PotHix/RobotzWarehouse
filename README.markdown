RobotzWarehouse
===============

RobotzWarehouse was created for the "Itau cultural gamejam".

Disclaimer
----------

This game was my first contact with C++ (in 2009) and was made in 48 hours of
hard work and poor sleeping. It worked fine and we got the second place at the
contest but it isn't a good code to refer when trying to know more about me or
Bruno.

Idea
----

The player needs to organize the boxes by color. When a line is fulfilled with
boxes with the same color the level is done.

For each level done the crane goes faster and the level becomes bigger.
